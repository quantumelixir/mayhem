* Mayhem: Attack of the Clones!!!

Putting the first stable version out there.

Currently the source file organization is a mess (only
slightly). Ideally I should split off the Runner function from
github.com/quantumelixir/mayhem/robot but that would deluge the source
file with namespaces.

Nevertheless I think it's in a readable state.

** WHAT IS THIS?

Short answer: [[http://www.robozzle.com][Robozzle]] with clones!

** AWESOME! How do I try it?

$ go get github.com/quantumelixir/mayhem
$ go install github.com/quantumelixir/mayhem

$ ... edit main.go to input your configuration ... (there is some help
here to define functions) 

$ mayhem
